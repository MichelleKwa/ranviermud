command: group
body: |
  You may 'group' with other players and even some non-player characters.
  To begin, use 'group create'. After that you may 'group invite' others.
  
  'group accept' will accept an invitation.

  Grouping will allow you to overwhelm foes in combat, and to stick together while exploring Myelin.

  Rewards will be distributed to the whole group when victory is had.
