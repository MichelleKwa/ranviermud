  Abilities consist of skills, mutations, and feats.

  Skills typically pertain to something anyone can do, such as crafting. However, a skilled character can do it better, producing higher quality items and using less resources.

  Mutations involve a physical component, for example, growing sharp claws or chitinous armor. They are typically very visible, and can be passive or active. Some mutations can be temporarily disabled due to high damage to the appropriate limb.

  Feats are intrinsic superhuman or psionic abilities, and can be passive or active. Some active examples include remote healing or pyrokinesis. Passive feats include the ability to sense danger, or to automatically recover one's energy or health after exertion. Feats usually have a high cost. You may be able to heal yourself in the middle of a tough battle, but your focus will be wiped out, potentially limiting your abilities for minutes afterwards.
