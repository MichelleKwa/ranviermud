  Intellect is one of the four core attributes in Myelin.

  Your intellect describes your ability to solve a complex problem, as well as your ability to think on your feet (cleverness). It also helps determine how focused your character can be.

  Intellect may be used to pinpoint a target's weakness, search for clues to an abstract puzzle, craft or repair complex machinery, or amplify a psionic attack.
