  Quickness is one of the four core attributes in Myelin.

  Being quick can mean being fleet-footed enough to get out of harm's way, agile enough to safely leap from a roof, or dextrous enough to pick a complex lock in seconds flat.

  Quickness also aids in combat speed, movement cost reduction, and one's ability to use skill-based or ranged weaponry.
