  The four core attributes in Myelin are Might, Quickness, Intellect, and Willpower.
  Your attributes determine a few aspects of your character, including:
  - Your ability to effectively use certain pieces of equipment.
  - The abilities you can obtain.
  - Your interactions with certain NPCs and environmental hazards.
  - Your chance of success in activities directly related to each attribute.

  For more on each individual attribute, see the attribute's specific help page.
  Since Myelin is a classless system, it is possible to focus on any number of attributes when building your character.
