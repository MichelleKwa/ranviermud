  There are four core attributes in Myelin, as well as three pools and two secondary attributes.
  Let's start with the core attributes, which can be subdivided as follows:
    
    Physical
    ---------
    Quickness
    Might
    
    Mental
    ---------
    Willpower
    Intellect

    Quickness determines how fast you can move and how dextrous you are. Combat speed and dodge chance are some things affected by quickness.

    Might is a measurement of strength and endurance. It affects how hard you hit in melee combat, for one.

    Willpower describes your mental and emotional fortitude. You use this attribute to resist psionic attacks, and to power your own.

    Intellect measures your reasoning ability. It is used for a variety of abilities and skills.

    Next up are our two derived attributes, Critical and Armor:
    
    Critical determines your chance of a critical hit during combat or a critical success when using a skill. It is akin to luck.

    Armor is determined by your equipment and some abilities, and determines your ability to resist physical damage from a direct hit.

    Finally, the three pools:

    Health
    Energy
    Focus

    Health describes how much more damage you can take before your physical body, your vessel, dies.
    Energy is depleted by physical abilities (those linked to Quickness or Might). 
    Focus is depleted by mental abilities (those linked to Willpower or Intellect).

    While depleting your energy or focus can have negative effects, it will not result in death.
