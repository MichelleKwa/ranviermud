  "Might is one of the four core attributes in Myelin.
  Your might describes your physical strength and constitution.
  It can determine the damage dealt in melee combat, as well as your
  own ability to take damage and stand tall. It also plays a part in
  resisting certain physical effects such as disease.
  Mightier characters can carry more things, wear heavier armor, and
  channel their strength into powerful feats.
