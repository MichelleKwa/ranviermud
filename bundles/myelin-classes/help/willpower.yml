  Willpower is one of the four core attributes in Myelin.

  Willpower describes your ability to sustain and resist both psionic and physical attacks.
  A character with high willpower will not crumble easily, and can survive otherwise devastating incidents.

  Willpower also contributes to your health, focus, endurance, charisma (when dealing with certain NPCs), and survival skills.
