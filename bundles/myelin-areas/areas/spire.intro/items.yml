        Containment Of Vessels: "This report begins, 'Over the centuries, the Ranvierii have collected untold numbers of vessels for their mind-body experimentation. They are kept in the depths of our Spire, frozen, until a consciousness has need...' and it goes on to detail the procedures for automating proper storage of humanoid cadavers for reuse."
        The City Of Myelin: "A brief overview of the history of a city called 'Myelin'. It is described as a cultural hub brought together by a peace between four formerly-warring factions: the Ranvierii, the Eligere, the Tremonts, and the Anzeige. The city started as a military encampment and grew into a mechanized arcology, shielded from the outside world. The peoples who founded Myelin are now extinct, though their legacies have shaped the city and its four quarters, as well as the Labyrinthine Spire in its heart."
        The Ranvierii: "The Ranvierii were known as the mystical survivalists of Myelin. Millenia ago, they had settled in the deserts to the west, beyond a treacherous mountain range. They studied the inner workings of the mind, consciousness, and the spirit. They trained willpower and quickness through intense meditation, sleight of hand, parkour, and martial arts."
        The Eligere: "The Eligere are Myelin's premiere scholars and diplomats. They settled the temperate land north of Myelin, and founded the city through a truce with the Tremonts centuries past. They study alchemy and the inner workings of the world, bending it to their will and intellect."
        The Tremonts: "The Tremonts are historically a seafaring tribe. They settled in the port town that eventually became Myelin, and are known as swashbuckling adventurers as well as hardworking farmers. They value might and quickness over all else, preferring instinct to intellect."
        The Anzeige: "The Anzeige come from the mountains south of what is now Myelin. A warfaring people, the Anzeige display great might and willpower, and nearly conquered Myelin before being beat back by a coalition of the other three factions."
        The Spire: "This report begins, 'The Spire was created after the truce between the Ranvierii, Eligere, Tremonts, and Anzeige -- its construction began approximately one century before the creation of this datacrystal. The four peoples collaborated on projects that were previously thought to be impossible. Their codenames include: 'Ex Nihilo', 'Ungenocide', 'Sacred Naming', and 'Extropy'. As a result of these experiments, and the growing need to defend them from heretics, a powerful psionic forcefield was built to radiate from the Spire, protecting Myelin from the outside world." 
        Project Ex Nihilo: "PROJECT EX NIHILO:\nStart date: ██████\nCompletion date: ██████ Principal scientists: Mahabharata ███████, Elegans ██████, J. Icahn ████████████\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS:\nWhile experiments in physical immortality have been abject failures, resulting in loss of █████ subjects and the discovery of ██ new cancers, research in the direction of consciousness transfer as a vehicle for immortality has seen a promising ██% success rate.\n\nThus far, all subjects have survived, however many suffer from various forms of amnesia, loss of motor function, ████████ of the ████, and post-transfer depression. The principal scientists request the acquisition of █████ subjects from the Hinterlands to continue this research."
