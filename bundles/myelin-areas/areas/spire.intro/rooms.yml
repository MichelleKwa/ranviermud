  description: "An alcove lined with grey, frost-crusted cylinders, jutting from a slate wall. Your surroundings seem to be made of the same dark material, though the ceiling is covered with pipes leading to the cylinders. There is only one way out."

  title: Pipe Chamber
  description: "A monolithic, circular chamber. Most of the center of this hollow area is obstructed by a mass of opaque tubes emerging from the floor, and traveling along the ceiling in snakelike patterns, only to disappear into the walls. In one direction is a dark, cold alcove. In the opposite direction is a small door flooded with light."
