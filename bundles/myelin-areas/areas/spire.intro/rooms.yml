  title: A Frosted Tomb
  description: "An alcove lined with grey, frost-crusted cylinders, jutting from a slate wall. Your surroundings seem to be made of the same dark material, though the ceiling is covered with pipes leading to the cylinders. There is only one way out."

  title: Pipe Chamber
  description: "A monolithic, circular chamber. Most of the center of this hollow area is obstructed by a mass of opaque tubes emerging from the floor, and traveling along the ceiling in snakelike patterns, only to disappear into the walls. In one direction is a dark, cold alcove. In the opposite direction is a small door flooded with light."

  title: Observation Deck
  description: "A semi-circular bench juts from the floor in the center of this small room. An eery light fills this otherwise plain room from the south. To the north is a dark chamber. To the south is a clear wall of thick glass. Beyond, you see four glowing crystals. To the east and west are heavy metal doors."
