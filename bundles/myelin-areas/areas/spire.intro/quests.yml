   You awaken from your slumber, finding yourself on the floor in front of a glass <white>cylinder</white>. You are covered in a viscous fluid.
   Your surroundings seem vaguely familiar. You know you need to find a way out.

   You have a gut feeling that you cannot stay here forever.
   A strange, mechanical voice bellows from the east.

    It seems all is not well here. 
    
    Thus far you have seen only peaceful automatons on this floor, and perhaps the occasional confused wanderer such as yourself.

    Perhaps a nearby datacrystal has more information?

    You have found a way out, but to use it, you will need something called an Axon.
    Perhaps an automaton will have one.
    
    Perhaps you could make your own.
